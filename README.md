## Work Experience
At work, I participated in several projects created in Laravel, while I was also responsible for the frontend.
- E-shop (mainly focused on clothing), where it was necessary to solve performance optimization and the amount of data due to the extensive structure with categories and subcategories. The integration was done via GraphQL API and Money S3 software, with Stripe payment gateway.
- A financial system that processed personal data with the storage of files on an FTP server and the possibility of manipulating files through the FileManager library. I used a template that I significantly adapted to the needs of the project.
- Realtime contract system via Pusher.js, which displayed current contracts on an interactive table via REST API and enabled monitoring of employees' success in concluding contracts.
- DIGI GO frontend redesign using Tailwind and Vue.js, while I also programmed the backend from Nette to Laravel, no database was used but only Rest API and XML file, and payment gateways were integrated through TatraBanka and GlobalPayments.
- Planner for technicians, which includes order management and efficient work with EAN codes. In this project, I solved problems with loading and validating EAN codes using regular expressions (regex). The data was stored in the MariaDB database and inventory control was provided through integration with the REST API.
